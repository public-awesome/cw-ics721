Configuration is in the `env` file, that is the most likely place you want to adjust

## Initializing new data

```bash
scripts/wasmd/generate_template.sh

## Starting the blockchain

Run the following:

```bash
scripts/wasmd/start.sh

While running the blockchain in one terminal, open a second one and run this:

```bash
scripts/wasmd/stop.sh
```
