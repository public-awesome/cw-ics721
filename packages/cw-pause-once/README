This provides a simple type, `PauseOrchestrator`, that allows a
specified address to execute a pause a single time and pause for a
prespecified duration.

This might be useful if you want to delegate the ability to pause
a contract to an address, while also not allowing that address to
perminantly lock the contract. For example, you may want to set
the prespecified duration to slightly over one governance cycle
for SDK governance, and then set a small subDAO as the
pauser. This way the subDAO may pause the contract quickly, but
must be reauthorized by governance to do it again.
